# The Smartass Silencer

> *Automated ego deflation for the modern era.*

The **Smartass Silencer** is a React-based PWA designed to analyze pretentious statements, "LinkedIn thought leadership," and confidently incorrect technical assertions. It uses Google's Gemini AI to generate surgically precise, devastating comebacks in either **British Cynicism** or **German Efficiency** modes.
